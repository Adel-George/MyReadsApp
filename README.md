-- Currently Reading
-- Want to Read
-- Read
- [Search page] The search page has a text input that may be used to find books. the books that match that query is displayed on the page, that lets you add the book to your library.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React Js
- Book Api

## Search Page

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.
